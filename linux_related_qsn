Q. When using the shell with multiple commands, what is the difference between “I” and “>” ?
Answer: Pipe (I) forwards the standard output of one command and feeds it as standard input to other commands in the chain of multiple commands whereas “>” can be used to redirect the output of one command into a file.

Q.If I want to list of all of the files a process has open, what are some ways I can do that?
Answer:In order to see list of all the files opened by process we can use lsof command. We can use losof command in number of ways to get the information about the required process. Simply typing lsof in the console will show all the files kept open by the active processes. Lsof |wc -l will show the count of open files of the processes. We can also list the open files related to specific processes using pid info, i.e., lsof -p 3345 will list the open files associated with the process id 3345. If we want to see the files that are open in a directory then we can use lsof +d ‘/manish/anish’. However this command does not open the files of the subdirectories. If we want to see the open files in subdirectories as well we can use lsof +D ‘/manish/anish’. Similarly, lsof -u anish will show the list of all open files used by processes owned by the user named anish. 

Q. How can I see what network ports are being listened to on a machine?
Answer: For any running service, it is essential to make sure that the service is listening to the correct network port. In order to list the services listening to ports on a linux server, we can use ‘netstat’ command. We can also use losf and ss command to check ports. In order to list all the TCP ports that are being listened on , we can use netsta -plnt command. This will also show name of each listener’s daemon and the PID.
